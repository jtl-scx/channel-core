/**
 * JTL-Channel API
 *
 * JTL-Channel API is a REST-based API that helps a Channel Integrator to connect Marketplace with the JTL-Wawi  ERP System.  # Key Features  With the JTL-Channel API, you can:    * Describe connected Marketplace Data Structure by providing Category and Attribute Data   * Manage Product and Offer Listings   * Manage Orders    * Handle the Post Order Process  # Development Guide  There is a detailed development guide available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jtl-scx/dev-guide/blob/main/Guide/Channel-API.md).  # Changelog  ## 2025-05-19  New Endpoint: We’ve introduced a new `PATCH /v1/channel` endpoint, enabling channel operators to  update metadata of their channel integration—such as name, website, feature flags, and supported locales—without a full resubmission.  This addition allows for more flexible and efficient channel maintenance.  To ensure secure access, updates require verification through a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) mechanism.  Each request must include a valid mfaPin, sent to a predefined mfaContact email address.  ### Added  - `PATCH /v1/channel`: New endpoint to partially update channel metadata   - `mfaContact`: New property used to define the recipient of MFA PINs (required prior to using PATCH)   - `mfaPin`: New property required in PATCH requests for authorization - `GET /v1/channel/mfa-pin`: Supporting endpoint to generate MFA PINs - New error codes:   - `GHN900`: MFA PIN is missing   - `CHN901`: MFA PIN is invalid or expired   - `CHN910`: mfaContact is not configured for the channel  ## 2025-01-15  New endpoint `GET /v1/channel/seller/list` added to list all SellerIds known by SCX-API with current status.  - `GET /v1/channel/seller/list`: New endpoint added  ## 2024-07-08  Added an optional property invoiceDocumentTransfer, indicating whether invoices must be uploaded by the seller  or provided by the channel. If not set, the channel's default settings will be used.  - `POST /v1/channel/order`:   - `requestBody`: added support for `invoiceDocumentTransfer` property  ## 2024-02-26  Improved error messaging by introducing `relatedAttributeId` and `recommendedValue` properties to the  OfferListingFailedError object. These enhancements aim to provide clearer, actionable feedback to users  encountering errors, thereby improving the API's usability and integration experience.  ### Added  - `POST /v1/channel/offer/listing-failed`:     - `requestBody`: added support for `offerList`.`errorList`.`relatedAttributeId` property    - `requestBody`: added support for `offerList`.`errorList`.`recommendedValue` property  ## 2024-02-08  We've implemented an internal cleanup process that permanently removes sellers from the SCX system when they no  longer have an active subscription with JTL-Software, marked by a new permanentlyRemoved property.  ### Added  - `GET /v1/channel/event`: Added property `permanentlyRemoved` to `SellerEventSellerUnlinked`  ## 2024-01-16  Enhanced data customization options for orders and their items, offering more detailed  information handling in the JTL-Wawi.  ### Added  - `POST /v1/channel/order`:     - `requestBody`: added support for `orderList`.`items`.`additionalOrderData` property    - `requestBody`: added support for `orderList`.`items`.`orderItem`.`items`.`additionalOrderItemData` property  ## 2023-10-09  Transitioning from a single report submission method to a more flexible chunk-based approach,  allowing for the handling of larger report data more efficiently.  ### Deprecation  - deprecate `POST` `/v1/channel/report/{reportId}` in favor of `POST` `/v1/channel/report/{reportId}/data`  ### Added  - added `POST` `/v1/channel/report/{reportId}/data` - added `POST` `/v1/channel/report/{reportId}/completed`
